Yashwanth Kumar — Developer Portfolio

A modern, interactive developer portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion — featuring a 3D animated hero background, live GitHub project integration, and a custom AI assistant trained on my profile.

✨ Features


Animated Hero Section — Typewriter role animation and a Three.js-powered neural network background (@react-three/fiber)
Yash AI Chatbot — A personal AI assistant (floating bubble + dedicated section) that answers questions about my skills, projects, education, and achievements. Falls back to an offline keyword-matching engine if no API is configured
AI Terminal — A fun, interactive command-line easter egg (help, whoami, skills, social, matrix, and more) for exploring the site
Live GitHub Projects — Pulls and displays my latest repositories directly from the GitHub API, with skeleton loading states for a smooth experience
Skills Showcase — Filterable, categorized skill cards with hover tooltips showing which projects each technology was used in
Fully Responsive — Optimized for desktop and mobile

🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

bashgit clone https://github.com/Sunny123yash/yashwanth-portfolio.git
cd yashwanth-portfolio

The app will be running at http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in your terminal).

Build for production

bashnpm run build

🤖 Yash AI

Yash AI is a personal assistant baked into the portfolio, available both as a floating chat bubble (bottom-right) and as a dedicated section on the page. It answers questions like:


"What are your skills?"
"Tell me about your projects"
"Why should I hire you?"
"What are your career goals?"


It runs entirely offline by default using a structured knowledge base and keyword matcher, with an optional upgrade path to a real LLM-powered backend via a /api/chat endpoint.

💻 AI Terminal

Click the terminal icon (bottom-left) to open a retro command-line interface. Type help to see all available commands — including quick navigation, profile lookups, and a couple of hidden easter eggs.
